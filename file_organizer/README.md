# File Organizer

The second project is the File Organizer. This application organizes your files into folders based on your preferences.

## Features

- **Custom Configuration**: The application organizes your files according to a `config.ini` file. You can use your own configuration or use the one provided with the application.

- **AI Organization**: By using the `--use-ai` flag, the application leverages AI to organize your files. The AI uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to scan common file types (such as pictures and text files) and organizes them into appropriate folders.

- **Options**: The application provides several options for customization, such as `dry-run` and `logging`.

## Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the application:

```bash
python script.py C:\Users\user\Downloads --use-ai --dry-run --log-level DEBUG
```

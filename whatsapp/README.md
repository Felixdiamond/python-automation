# Whatsapp Automation

Welcome to my first automation project! This application allows you to send messages to any specified contact with ease and flexibility. 

## Features

- **Flexible Messaging**: You can type your message in any format you prefer. For example, "Send a message to +0000000000000 by 8pm telling him to get ready for the meeting by 9". The application will process your request and ensure that your message is sent to the intended recipient by 8pm.

- **Future Enhancements**: I am currently working on adding more features to this application. One such feature includes the ability to send a message to a group of people without specifying their numbers, just their names.
